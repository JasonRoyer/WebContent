The relations and their attributes are as follows: 

test - clientID (PK), testType (PK), passed, reason, testDate(PK);
client - clientID(PK/FK), name, gender, address, city, phoneNum, validLicense;
interview - clientID(PK/FK), empID, interviewDate, needs;
lesson - lessonNum(PK), carID(FK), clientID(FK), empID(FK), fee, lessonDate, milesDriven;
employee - empID(PK), name, DOB, phoneNum, gender, jobTitle, carID(FK), officeID(FK);
car - carID(PK), mileage, faults, empID(FK);
office - officeID(PK), officeName, managerID(FK), phoneNum, address, city, state

The test relation is in 3rd normal form in that the "passed" and "reason" attributes rely on the clientID-testType-testDate composite superkey; 
that is, "passed" and "reason" are functionally determined by the composite primary key of clientID-testType-testDate, and no transitive
dependencies exist.

The client relation is in 3rd normal form in that the name, gender, address, city, phoneNum, and validLicense attributes are functionally
determined by the clientID. The personal details of the client can only be dependent on the ID that uniquely identifies the individual, and
no transitive dependencies exist.

The interview relation is 3rd normal form because the empID, interviewDate, and needs attributes are functionally determined by
the clientID; that is, an employee is assigned to interview a client, so this is determined directly by the client, as are the needs
of the client and the date of the interview, and no transitive dependencies exist.

The lesson relation is in 3rd normal form because the carID, clientID, empID, fee, lessonDate, and milesDriven attribute are directly tied to
the lesson itself; that is, the car, employee, client, fee, date, and miles driven in a car are functionally determined by the lesson itself, which
is uniquely identified by an ID, which is the primary key of the relation. No transitive dependencies exist.

The employee relation is in 3rd normal form because the name, DOB, phoneNum, gender, jobTitle, carID, and officeID are tied to empID primary key.
That is, the attributes correspond to the attributes of the employee, so the ID that uniquely identifies said employee determines these characteristics, and no
transitive dependencies exist.

The car relation is in 3rd normal form because the mileage, faults, and empID are determined by the carID primary key, and cannot be functionally determined
from one another, and no transitive dependencies exist.

The office relation is in 3rd normal form because the officeName, managerID, phoneNum, address, city, and state are all functionally determined by the officeID 
primary key; that is, these attributes can only be determined by a uniquely identified office, and not by each other, and no transitive dependencies exist.
